            <li>The "-b" flag creates a new branch.</li>
            <li>For example: The "feature/starter-code" branch is the name of the new branch that was created for the purpose of adding the starter code to the project. We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.
